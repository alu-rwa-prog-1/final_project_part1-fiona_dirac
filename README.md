# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## DESCRIPTION

This project came about after the announcement of the new library on the new campus and we realized we could make
a management system to make it easy for all ALU students, the librarian, and the ALU staff to access, use, and manage it.
The project will mainly use Python programming language

## FUTURES

* enable students to easily borrow, return and access books in the library
* enable facilitators to easily borrow, return and access books in the library(can do so in mass quantities if necessary
for a lecture)
* enable the librarian to be able to add and remove books to the collection
* enable users to browse through the library for books they are interested in
* enable users to register/login into the system
* enable the presence of both online and physical resources
* some other futures related to other one :
  - extend deadline for returning a book.
